My internship journey at **AMAZON WEB SERVICES VIETNAM CO., LTD** from **September 8, 2025** to **December 24, 2025** has been a valuable experience. With the opportunity to meet many peers, practice, and use AWS convenient services, as well as expand my knowledge of **cloud computing**, I was extremely excited about these experiences. This was not only theoretical knowledge but also hands-on practice in a professional working environment.

In particular, I participated in the **Online Platform for Hurricane Trajectory** project with the **SKYNET** team. The project was created to provide an online platform for internet users to access and track the latest information on hurricanes in the West Pacific region. Moreover, it features a unique capability that allows users to experience **hurricane trajectory prediction models** simply by entering a few data points about the hurricane’s past movements. Additionally, the project developed algorithms such as **Stepwise Temporal Fading Augmentation and Geodesic Beering**, offering diversified data augmentation options for training time-series models. Most notably, it addresses bias, emphasizing the most recent records to ensure realistic and accurate predictions**—a technique that, to date, has not been widely explored in **time-series data augmentation** research.

Through this experience, I have **improved several skills**, including:

* Analyzing and solving problems
* Collecting and processing information from reliable sources
* Researching and experimenting to find new methods by combining existing knowledge
* Organizing model training and applying new techniques in Machine Learning
* Integrating AWS cloud services in workflow and deploying the online platform into a functional product
* Enhancing soft skills
* Becoming more confident in presenting proposals and improving communication and teamwork with others

I have consistently tried to complete assigned tasks and felt very engaged and satisfied when working with new knowledge, especially when I first encountered and explored AWS services.

To present a clearer self-assessment of my internship experience, I would evaluate myself based on the following criteria:
