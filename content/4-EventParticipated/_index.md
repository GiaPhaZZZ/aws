&emsp;**Lesson learned:** DevSecOps is not only about automating the CI/CD pipeline but also about integrating security as a core part of the entire software development lifecycle. The adoption of AI and Generative AI accelerates vulnerability detection, automates testing processes, and enhances incident response capabilities.





### [Event 4](4.4-Event4/)

&emsp;**Event Name:**  AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1 - AI/ML/GenAI on AWS Workshop

&emsp;**Date & Time:** 8:30, November 15, 2025

&emsp;**Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Tower, 02 Hai Trieu Street, Saigon Ward, Ho Chi Minh City 

&emsp;**Role:** Attendee  

&emsp;**Main activities:** Introduce the practical applications of AI and prompt engineering in work and daily life. Explore several AWS machine learning services that assist with a variety of tasks, including image recognition, text-to-speech, search, personalization, and more.

&emsp;**Lesson learned:** AI and prompt engineering are not just tools for automation, but powerful enablers to enhance productivity and decision-making in daily work and personal tasks. Leveraging AWS ML services—such as image recognition, text-to-speech, search, and personalization—demonstrates how AI can simplify repetitive tasks, provide insights faster, and improve user experience. Integrating these services thoughtfully into workflows ensures efficiency while maintaining control and reliability.




### [Event 5](4.5-Event5/)

&emsp;**Event Name:**  AWS Cloud Mastery Series #2 - DevOps on AWS

&emsp;**Date & Time:** 8:30, November 17, 2025

&emsp;**Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Tower, 02 Hai Trieu Street, Saigon Ward, Ho Chi Minh City 

&emsp;**Role:** Attendee  

&emsp;**Main activities:** Learning DevOps principles, building automated CI/CD pipelines, exploring Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with CloudFormation and CDK, comparing AWS container services (ECS, EKS, App Runner), and understanding observability practices using CloudWatch.

&emsp;**Lesson learned:** Effective DevOps is not only about implementing automation in CI/CD pipelines but also about fostering collaboration between development and operations teams, integrating continuous feedback, and leveraging IaC for repeatable, reliable infrastructure. Using AWS services to containerize applications and enhance observability ensures faster delivery, reduced human error, and scalable, resilient systems.





### [Event 6](4.6-Event6/)

&emsp;**Event Name:**  AWS Edge Services Workshop - Amazon CloudFront as Your Foundation

&emsp;**Date & Time:** 9:00, November 19, 2025

&emsp;**Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Tower, 02 Hai Trieu Street, Saigon Ward, Ho Chi Minh City

&emsp;**Role:** Attendee  

&emsp;**Main activities:** Exploring CloudFront’s edge capabilities, including security features (TLS, mutual TLS, origin cloaking), cost optimization techniques, caching strategies, edge logic implementation with CloudFront Functions/Lambda@Edge, and best practices for high availability, performance, and reliability.

&emsp;**Lesson learned:** Implementing edge services goes beyond deploying a CDN; it requires integrating security, caching, and failover strategies to optimize performance and reduce origin load. Leveraging CloudFront’s advanced features and following best practices ensures resilient, cost-effective, and globally performant content delivery while maintaining full operational visibility.


### [Event 7](4.7-Event7/)

&emsp;**Event Name:**  Master 3 — Security (AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar)

&emsp;**Date & Time:** 9:00, November 29, 2025

&emsp;**Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Tower, 02 Hai Trieu Street, Saigon Ward, Ho Chi Minh City

&emsp;**Role:** Attendee

&emsp;**Main activities:** Exploring the core principles of the AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar, including identity and access management, continuous monitoring, multi-layer network protection, incident response automation, and multi-account governance. The session also covered hands-on insights into services such as IAM Access Analyzer, GuardDuty, Security Hub, CloudTrail, and EventBridge to help build secure and scalable AWS architectures.

&emsp;**Lesson learned:** Security is an ongoing process rather than a one-time configuration. Applying least privilege, enforcing strong authentication, maintaining comprehensive logging, and automating detection and response workflows are essential to reducing risks. Combining GuardDuty, Security Hub, and EventBridge enhances visibility and consistency across accounts and regions. A defense-in-depth approach greatly improves reliability, availability, and overall system resilience in the cloud.


### [Event 8](4.8-Event8/)
