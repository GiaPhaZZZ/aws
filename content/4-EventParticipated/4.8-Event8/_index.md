### Event Objectives

* Provide a structured overview of **Agentic AI** and the shift toward autonomous AI systems
* Introduce **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore** and AWS’s agentic ecosystem
* Demonstrate real-world **Agentic Workflow** design on AWS
* Showcase **CloudThinker Agentic Orchestration** and context optimization techniques
* Deliver hands-on experience building agentic applications using AWS Bedrock
* Create a space for networking with industry experts across the AI and cloud ecosystem

### Speakers

* **Nguyen Gia Hung** – Head of Solutions Architect, AWS
* **Kien Nguyen** – Solutions Architect, AWS
* **Viet Pham** – Founder & CEO, Diaflow
* **Thang Ton** – Co-founder & COO, CloudThinker
* **Henry Bui** – Head of Engineering, CloudThinker
* **Kha Van** – Community Leader, AWS


### Key Highlights

#### The Evolution of Agentic AI

**Traditional ML / classical AI**

* Fixed tasks, narrow capabilities
* Require structured datasets and extensive preprocessing
* Limited scalability and adaptability

**Modern Agentic AI**

* Driven by Foundation Models and multi-step reasoning
* Autonomous task decomposition & tool usage
* Can integrate APIs, execute workflows, retrieve knowledge
* Highly flexible and production-ready when paired with AWS services

#### Challenges in Bringing Agentic AI to Production

* Performance – latency, parallel reasoning, token throughput
* Scalability – multi-agent workloads, context management
* Security – data governance, identity flow, access control
* Governance – observability, audit trails, task boundaries

#### AWS Agentic AI Portfolio

* Amazon Bedrock AgentCore – identity, memory, runtime, tools, workflows
* Agent Gateway – unified tool & API integration
* Model flexibility – choose from Anthropic, Meta Llama, Amazon Titan, and more
* Production-focused design – scaling, guardrails, observability

#### Amazon Bedrock AgentCore (by AWS)

* Runtime – Manages multi-step task execution
* Memory – Long-term and short-term context retention
* Identity Flow – Enforces permissions, security boundaries
* Agent Gateway – Connects to tools, APIs, internal systems
* Code Interpreter – Safe execution environment for dynamic code
* Browser Tool – Retrieves external or web-based information
* Observability – Tracing, logs, metrics for debugging & governance


#### Building Agentic Workflow on AWS (Use Case by Diaflow)

* Multi-agent coordination
* Context retrieval and function calling
* Linking agents to enterprise data sources
* Orchestrating business logic through Bedrock & Diaflow tools
* Practical implementation patterns for startups & SMEs

#### CloudThinker Agentic Orchestration & Context Optimization

* High-level agent-to-agent coordination patterns
* Intelligent context filtering & optimization for model efficiency
* Dynamic workflow adaptation
* Evaluating and improving chain-of-thought reliability
* Integrating CloudThinker with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore

#### CloudThinker Hack: Hands-On Workshop

* Setting up Bedrock agents
* Building a simple agentic pipeline
* Integrating external tools into workflows
* Debugging and optimizing agent behavior
* Deploying a working proof-of-concept


### Key Takeaways

#### Agentic AI Mindset

* AI is shifting from responding → **acting**
* Agents must integrate memory, tools, orchestration, and identity
* Foundation Models + Orchestration = new generation of AI applications
* AWS provides the strongest production-ready environment for Agentic AI

#### Technical Understanding

* The importance of **context optimization**
* How tool usage and identity flow affect agent reliability
* Why AgentCore simplifies multi-step reasoning
* The value of real-world orchestration patterns
* How to connect FMs with APIs, business logic, and data repositories


##### Practical Development Skills

* Designing an end-to-end AI workflow
* Connecting external tools into an agent pipeline
* Managing multi-agent interactions
* Understanding latency, scaling, and security considerations
* Deploying agents safely with guardrails & monitoring


##### Applying to Work

Participants can immediately apply what they learned:

* Build **agent-based assistants**, automation pipelines, or internal copilots
* Integrate AWS Bedrock models into enterprise systems
* Use AgentCore to create multi-step, governed workflows
* Build prototypes faster—**without DevOps-heavy infrastructure**
* Experiment with CloudThinker orchestration techniques for better performance
* Apply agentic design patterns in real startup or enterprise contexts
