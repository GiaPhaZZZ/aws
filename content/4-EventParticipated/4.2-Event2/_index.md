# Summary Report: “Data Science on AWS”

### Event Objectives

* To introduce AWS’s specialized services for the AI field.
* To explain key concepts in machine learning.
* To demonstrate the use of several AWS services.

### Speakers

* **Văn Hoàng Kha** – Cloud Solutions Architect, AWS Community Builder
* **Bạch Doãn Vương** – Cloud Development Engineer, AWS Community Builder

### Key Highlights

#### Cloud Service Utilities for Data Science

* Provide APIs for models, reducing the need for heavy coding.
* Support efficient data cleaning and transformation.
* Enable large-scale and parallel processing.
* Offer multiple platforms for model training on AWS.
* Assist in model deployment, usage, and packaging.

#### Fundamental Concepts in Data Science

* **AI (Artificial Intelligence):** Techniques that allow computers to mimic human intelligence using logic, if-then rules, and machine learning.
* **Machine Learning:** A subset of AI that uses algorithms to detect patterns in data and build logical models.
* **Deep Learning:** A subset of machine learning that uses multi-layer neural networks to perform complex tasks.
* **Generative AI:** A type of neural network trained on massive datasets from major tech companies, capable of creativity and generating new content.

#### Amazon Comprehend

* AWS service for text classification and analysis.
* Supports personal information identification (PII).
* Understands multiple languages and detects sentiment.
* Extracts events and key phrases from text.

#### Amazon Translate

* Specialized in translation and summarization; can generate data for chatbots.
* Highly accurate and easy to integrate into applications.
* A fully managed service, offering complete user control.

#### Amazon Textract

* Extracts text and data from virtually any document.
* Enables text conversion and multilingual processing.

#### Amazon Polly and Amazon Transcribe

* **Polly:** Text-to-speech service.
* **Transcribe:** Speech-to-text service.
* Both support multiple languages and conversion types.

#### Amazon Lex

* Enables creation of conversational interfaces for any application.
* Provides fast, visually appealing, and time-saving interface design.
* Easy to use with built-in integrations and high-quality text output.

#### Amazon Rekognition
