# Summary Report “Vietnam Cloud Day 2025: Ho Chi Minh City Connect Edition for Builders”

### Purpose of the Event

- Raise awareness of the importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI).  
- Highlight the applications of Generative AI (GenAI) across multiple domains of life.  
- Introduce new services from Amazon Web Services (AWS).  

### List of Speakers

- **Eric Yeo** – Country General Manager, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos & Myanmar, AWS  
- **Dr. Jens Lottner** – CEO, Techcombank  
- **Ms. Trang Phung** – CEO & Co-Founder, U2U Network  
- **Jaime Valles** – Vice President, General Manager Asia Pacific and Japan, AWS  

### Key Highlights

#### Vietnam adopting digital technology and cloud computing as the foundation for Industry 4.0  

- Expansion of cloud and digital infrastructure.  
- Increased licensing opportunities for companies and foreign investors.  
- Strong emphasis on security and information protection.  

#### U2U Network – Technology infrastructure integrated with Generative AI to simplify blockchain adoption  

By combining its existing technologies with Generative AI, U2U Network makes blockchain more approachable for new users and businesses. Some examples of AI’s role in shaping Vietnam’s technology landscape include:  
- 60% of Vietnamese students now use edtech applications.  
- Over 765 AI startups exist in Vietnam, ranking second in Southeast Asia.  
- Healthcare services have become more accessible and cost-efficient—e.g., at Hospital 10A, AI-assisted consultations reduced examination time to just 5 minutes per case.  
- Generative AI helps users make better everyday decisions.  

#### AWS’s investment in education  

- AWS has trained more than 100,000 builders in Vietnam.  
- Cloud services have become more accessible locally.  
- The **AWS Cloud Journey** program, lasting 6 months, ensures practical job opportunities.  
- AWS culture is a key differentiator that drives innovation.  

#### The importance of AI technology transfer  

- Today represents a unique moment in history where AI is transforming everything.  
- Beyond technology, AI adoption involves people, skills, culture, and society—fostering a culture of continuous learning.  
- Transition from “training mode” to “inference mode” with safe and responsible model usage.  
- AWS enables access to cutting-edge models. For instance, Nearmap helps customers focus on decision-making, creativity, and strategy while delegating repetitive tasks to machines.  

#### AWS SageMaker  

SageMaker enables developers and data scientists to build, train, and deploy machine learning models at scale on AWS, without the burden of infrastructure management. It provides:  
- **Data Preparation**: Tools for cleaning, organizing, and transforming datasets.  
- **Model Building and Training**: Pre-configured Jupyter notebooks with support for frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.  
- **Deployment**: Seamless cloud deployment with integration into other AWS services.  

#### AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC)  

Naïve AI-assisted coding—sometimes called *“vibe coding”*—lets AI perform all tasks. However, debugging becomes difficult, and models lack transparency. A more balanced approach, the **AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC)**, delegates many tasks to AI while humans retain control of core decisions. The process involves three stages:  

- **Inception**: Brainstorming ideas, defining requirements, and task planning.  
- **Construction**: Domain modeling, AI-assisted code generation, and testing.  
- **Operation**: Production deployment, incident management, and long-term maintenance.  

#### Securing AI Applications  

AI models often exhibit vulnerabilities, including hallucination (false but confident outputs), overconfidence, and susceptibility to data manipulation. To mitigate these risks, stronger policies are needed to ensure reliability and trust:  
- **AI governance policies**  
- **Root-cause analysis of hallucinations**  
- **Data poisoning prevention**  
- **Prompt security**  
- **Access control and authorization**  

### Lessons Learned

#### Work Mindset  
- **Problem Understanding**: Identify the customer’s needs and problems first.  
- **Planning and Strategy**: Develop a roadmap and select appropriate tools and services.  
- **Data Preparation**: Dedicate time to cleaning and preparing datasets for consistency and quality, minimizing rework later.  

#### Applying New Techniques  
- **Amazon Web Services**: Leverage cloud technologies to deliver higher-quality solutions.  
- **Emerging Technologies**: Stay updated with the latest research and techniques to remain competitive.  

#### AI Strategies  
- **AI in Work**: Strike a balance—AI should neither handle everything nor be sidelined. Combining human expertise with AI maximizes efficiency and outcomes.  
- **Increase Security**: Enhance security, mitigate risks, and strengthen AI capabilities to prevent data leakage and hallucinations during training.  

### Application to Work  

- **AWS SageMaker**: To be applied for building machine learning models in upcoming projects, leveraging cloud integration for better results.  
- **Amazon Q**: An AI-powered assistant for dashboards and conversational analytics, enabling more intuitive and user-friendly data exploration.  
- **AI-Driven Development Lifecycle**: Applying the three stages (Inception – Construction – Operation) for structured, AI-assisted development.  
- **Generative AI (GenAI)**: Used in research and ideation, both before and during project execution.  

### Experience at the Event  

Attending **“Vietnam Cloud Day 2025: Ho Chi Minh City Connect Edition for Builders”** was one of the most memorable experiences of my career. AWS organizes Cloud Day only once a year, and I was fortunate to participate. Beyond listening to speakers present new technologies, I also gained deeper awareness of the role of AI and cloud computing in building innovative, user-centric products.  

#### Knowledge from leading experts  

- Speakers and representatives of major tech corporations emphasized the role of **Generative AI** in shaping the future of technology.  
- Through practical examples, I better understood how to apply the **AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC)** and **Securing Generative AI Applications with AWS** in large-scale projects.  

#### Hands-on technical experience  

- Sessions on **U2U Network** illustrated how Generative AI enhances blockchain accessibility and decision-making.  
- Learned strategies to **strengthen security and reliability** in machine learning models, preventing leaks and hallucinations.  
- Gained practical insights on maximizing AI’s potential in project development.  

#### Exploring modern tools  

- Directly experimented with **Amazon SageMaker**, supporting end-to-end machine learning workflows.  
- Learned to use **Amazon Q** for creating dashboards and visualizing data more intuitively.  

#### Networking and discussions  

- Panel discussions brought together experts and CEOs from major corporations to address **GenAI strategies and leadership approaches**, providing a broad perspective on technology trends.  
- I gained insight into how to effectively use AI—not by giving it full control, nor by restricting it to side tasks, but by maximizing its supportive role in work.  

#### Key Takeaways  

- Applying **AI-DLC** significantly improves **work efficiency**, while saving **time** and **costs**.  
- Using **Generative AI (GenAI)** in research and knowledge acquisition streamlines learning and decision-making.  
- Tools such as **Amazon Q** and **SageMaker** can substantially **boost productivity** when integrated into projects.
