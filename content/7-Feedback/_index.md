### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  

The work environment is friendly and professional, with spacious and clean seating. One minor issue I noticed, common among students, is that some groups gather and talk too loudly, which makes it hard for me to focus on my tasks. Additionally, I hope AWS allows the use of the pantry to get water, because if I bring a bottle and finish it during work hours, I have to go all the way down to the ground floor to buy more, which wastes time. Otherwise, everything else was fine, and I have no further comments.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin** 

Mentors supported students quite well. However, when creating chat groups, there should ideally be two separate groups: one for announcements and one for casual conversation. Sometimes when I miss an announcement, it gets buried under other messages (chats, diagram questions, course sharing, etc.). I also want to thank the mentors for their support and contributions to AWS workshops, which helped us understand the services better.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  

I study AI, specializing in algorithm design, data processing, and model training. Most AWS services already provide AI models (e.g., Bedrock) that can be used via API without much involvement in this field. The main work mostly involves architecture and services rather than improving model features or accuracy/efficiency.

However, even though this is not exactly my major, I gained practical knowledge that cannot be learned at school. For example, knowing how to integrate an existing model and its API into software for end users, especially combined with cloud technology, is extremely valuable and will likely be useful in my future career.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  

Specifically, I learned things such as using SageMaker to run hurricane trajectory prediction models, exploring other AI-assisted services, using Lambda, S3, EC2, etc. Importantly, I learned more about operational cost calculation for the team. Previously, using RDS, EC2, etc., would result in a cost of around $58 per month. By switching to a serverless architecture using S3 and Lambda, the cost dropped to around $18. This is a noteworthy achievement during this OJT period. It also made me realize that IT work is not purely technical, but also involves cost-saving considerations for the business.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  

The company culture is generally optimistic and positive. Work is not overwhelming, there are many new things to learn, and teammates are friendly and open. However, some students (FPT students, to critique again) have poor communication skills, especially being passive and not contributing ideas for project development. Overall, though, the FCJ group is good, with peers supporting and sharing experiences with each other.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  

Allowing students to choose suitable office days was very reasonable. Working hours were standard, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. There were also events and workshops that were both useful and enjoyable.

### Additional Questions
- Meeting Mr.Eric Yeo in person was impressive. But the most satisfying aspect was learning how to calculate operational costs efficiently and reasonably.

- The areas for improvement have already been mentioned above. I hope in the future, AWS will allow interns to use the pantry to get drinking water.

- For students from my school majoring in software engineering or cybersecurity, I would definitely recommend AWS as an internship destination. With cloud infrastructures and the widespread adoption of cloud services, it’s a great place to gain knowledge and expand career opportunities.

### Suggestions & Expectations

- Some suggestions for future interns: speak more quietly in the office and be proactive and open in both work and life.

- Of course, FCJ with the J stands for a journey. And this journey does not end even when the OJT ends.
