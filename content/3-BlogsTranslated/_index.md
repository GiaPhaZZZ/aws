### [Blog 1 - Exploring Quantum Measurements, Observables and Operators: Practical insights with Amazon Braket](3.1-Blog1/)
This blog explores the mathematical foundations and practical implementation of **quantum measurement techniques** using **Amazon Braket**. You will learn how **basis transformations**, **projectors**, and **observables** work together to convert hidden quantum phase information into measurable outcomes — a key concept behind many quantum algorithms. The post also includes hands-on **Python examples** using Amazon Braket to simulate measurements in arbitrary bases, visualize results on the **Bloch sphere**, and connect theoretical insights with real quantum hardware experiments.

### [Blog 2 - Implement network connectivity patterns for Oracle Database@AWS](3.2-Blog2/)
This blog explains how to design and implement network connectivity patterns for Oracle Database@AWS (ODB@AWS). You will learn how to connect Oracle Exadata infrastructure running on AWS with your applications, on-premises environments, and multi-VPC architectures using AWS Transit Gateway and AWS Cloud WAN. The article details multiple IP routing-based architectures, including direct VPC peering, single-Region scalability, and multi-Region global connectivity. It also covers DNS configuration, security considerations, and best practices for integrating ODB@AWS into complex AWS network topologies while maintaining performance, security, and flexibility.

### [Blog 3 - Introducing universal installers for AWS CLI v2 on macOS](3.3-Blog3/)
This blog announces the release of universal macOS installers for the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) v2, starting from version 2.30.0. With this update, a single installer now runs natively on both Apple silicon and Intel processors, removing the need for Rosetta translation and simplifying installation across macOS devices.
