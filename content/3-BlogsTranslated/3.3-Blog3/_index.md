# Introducing universal installers for AWS CLI v2 on macOS

by Andrew Asseily | on 11 SEP 2025 | in Announcements, AWS CLI |


Amazon Web Services (AWS) is announcing the availability of universal macOS installers for the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) v2.

## What’s new

Starting with AWS CLI v2 version 2.30.0, the AWS CLI installers will provide universal binary support for macOS that works natively on both Apple silicon and Intel processors with a single download. This eliminates the need for Rosetta translation, a compatibility layer that enables Intel-based applications to run on Apple silicon Macs.

## Updating existing AWS CLI installations

If you’re using AWS CLI v2 on an Apple-silicon Mac, we recommend you upgrade to the latest version to install native binaries.

These changes only affect the official AWS CLI installers—building the AWS CLI from source will continue to natively support the host architecture.
